## About this repository
This repository is a collection of ARM assembly programs that I wrote while learning ARM assembly. The programs are written for the ARM64 architecture on a Macbook Pro.
I have used a series of resources to learn ARM including: 
- Programming with 64-Bit ARM Assembly Language Book
- Repositories and tools to help me understand the ARM64 with m1 context since there are some slight differences between the ARM64 architecture and the ARM64 architecture on the M1 chip. my code has been formatted extremely similar
